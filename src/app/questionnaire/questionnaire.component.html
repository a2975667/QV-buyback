	<p *ngIf="questionTitle!='QV Dry Run: Understanding what is Quadratic Voting'">People have different preferences in
		how resources should be allocated for different societal causes. Here we listed 9 different societal causes. For
		each of the causes listed below, what do you think about <b> how effort and resources should be contributed
			toward the causes? </b></p>
	<p>
		For this question, you will use a <b>Binary Quadratic Voting</b> method to express your preferences.
		<br><br>
		You will be given a budget of a certain number of <b> voice credits</b>. You will use the available credits to
		cast votes. If you think more resources should be allocated to a certain cause, you can cast multiple
		upvotes using the <b>+1 sign</b>. If you believe that less less resources should be allocated on a certain
		cause, you can cast a few downvotes using the <b> -1 sign</b>. If you are neutral on a cause, you can choose to
		cast <b> no vote </b>.

		<br><br>
		<b> Based on the intensity of your opinion, you can cast one or more upvote or downvotes for each cause</b>. The
		stronger your opinion is, the more votes you can put on one option. At the same time, as the number of votes
		increases, the voice credits it costs increases quadratically, i.e. <b> X votes will cost X^2 (square of X)
			credits</b>. The cost of some common number of votes is specified in the table below:
