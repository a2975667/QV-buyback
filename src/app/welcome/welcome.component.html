				You are being asked to participate in a voluntary research study. This study aims to understand how different people think about the importance of the different elements when watching a video. Participating in this study will involve using an interface that provides a set of configurations to experience how different combinations of video elements impact your watching experience. You will be asked to complete some tasks or surveys regarding a given video. The entire survey will last around 40 to 50 minutes. There are no known risks associated with our study.

			<h5>What procedures are involved?</h5>
			<p>
				<b></b> Throughout this experiment, we present a few video interfaces. We would ask you to tune and adjust the video interfaces to experience the impact of different video elements. You will be asked to watch the entire video, but feel free to spend as much time as you like with the interface. A questionnaire and a few tasks will then be presented to collect some of your experience watching the video.
