A small quiz will follow this page. </b> <br> <br> <h3> Quality of video imagery </h3> <br> <p> This refers to how <u>clear or crisp the visual</u> is in the video. It can be degraded because of the limited data being transmitted to your device. </p> <container> <video controls width=45%><source src=\"/api/video/bbb-perfect.webm\"></video> &nbsp; &nbsp; <video controls width=45%><source src=\"/api/video/bbb-vq0.webm\"></video> </container> <br> <p> Compare the two videos. When a video has <u>low-quality imagery</u>, the video can be <u>pixelated and unclear</u>, just like the clip on the right. The higher quality the imagery is, the crispier and clearer the video looks, as shown on the left. </p> <br> <h3> Quality of audio </h3> <br> <p> The second feature, audio quality, is similar. </p> <br> <audio controls > <source src=\"/api/video/bbb-perfect.m4a\"> </audio> &nbsp; &nbsp; <audio controls> <source src=\"/api/video/bbb-aq0.m4a\"> </audio> <br> <p> With high-quality audio, voices are clear and crisp, as shown in the first audio clip. The <u>lower the audio quality</u>, the more <u>muffled and unclear</u> the voice sounds, as you can hear in the second audio clip. </p> <br> <h3> Stability of video imagery</h3> <br> <p> The stability of video imagery refers to how smooth the visual of the video is. </p> <container> <video controls width=45%><source src=\"/api/video/bbb-perfect.webm\"></video> &nbsp; &nbsp; <video controls width=45%><source src=\"/api/video/bbb-vid_sutt.webm\"></video> </container> <br> <p> In the video on the left, the video imagery plays smoothly. When there is limited internet bandwidth, some information would be lost during transmission, creating stutters or pauses in the video imagery, as in the video on the right. The more <u>unstable</u> it is, the more <u>frequent pauses</u> there will be in the imagery. </p> <br> <h3> Stability of audio </h3> <br> <container> <video controls width=45%><source src=\"/api/video/bbb-perfect.webm\"></video> &nbsp; &nbsp; <video controls width=45%><source src=\"/api/video/bbb-aud_sutt.webm\"></video> </container> <br> <p> Again, like video imagery stability, the fourth element, stability of the audio, is about how fluent the audio sounds. Even though these two video clip shows the same imagery, the sound in the video clip on the right is <u>choppier</u> compared to the audio in the first video clip. That's becasue the video on the right has an <u>unstable audio</u>, and hence you will miss parts of the audio. </p> <br> <h3> Video-audio synchronization</h3> <br> <p> Finally, the synchronization between audio and video imagery may also be impacted by limited internet bandwidth. Perfect synchronization allows the visual in the video to match perfectly with the sound. As the audio and video imagery becomes <u>out of sync</u>, the video imagery will appear <u>more ahead</u> of the corresponding audio, showing considerable time lags. Compare the clips below. The one on the right is an example of how an out-of-sync video would be like. </p> <br> <container> <video controls width=45%><source src=\"/api/video/bbb-perfect.webm\"></video> &nbsp; &nbsp; <video controls width=45%><source src=\"/api/video/bbb-sync.webm\"></video> </container> <br> <br> <h3> Summary </h3><p> <b>In this study, we want to know how people prioritize the need for those different video elements.</b> These elements involve <b>the quality of the video</b> (how clear the visuals are), <b>quality of the audio</b> (how crisp the audio sounds), <b>stability of the audio</b> (how fluent the audio sounds), <b>stability of the video</b> (how smooth the visuals are), and finally, the <b>synchronization of the video and audio</b> (how well the visuals and the audio match up). </p> <p> <b>Once you have read through this information and feel like you have understood the concepts, please click Submit to move on to the next page and take a small quiz about your understanding of these video elements.</b> </p>"
