	"Description":"<p> <b>Now the online video streaming company wants you to complete a task on this page and the next page. Please read the following instructions carefully.</b> The task will allow the company to prioritize the different video elements when bandwidth is limited.</p><p> 1. <b>You will be given a task on the next page with another weather forecast video. You will be asked to watch the video and answer a list of 5 questions correctly to test your understanding of the video.</b> However, without any changes, the quality of that video will be as bad as the video shown on this page with all video elements at their default level 0. You will most likely not be able to answer the test questions correctly. <br><br> 2. <b>In order to enhance the video quality on the next page so that you could answer the test questions, you are given $30 from the video streaming company to enhance the five video elements to certain levels on this page.</b> Enhancing one level of each element costs $2. For example, to enhance audio stability from level 0 to level 2, it costs $4. <br><br>3. You DO NOT have to use up all of $30 in the purchase. The remaining amount from the $30 after the purchase will be awarded to you as a bonus <b>if you are the winner of the lottery with a chance of 1 in 30. However, you will only be eligible to enter the lottery if you answer 4 of the 5 questions correctly on the next page.</b><br><br>4. <b>You will use the sliders in the control panel below to indicate the levels you want to purchase for each video element.</b> As you move a slider to a certain level, you can preview the effect on the video below. You will also <b>see the cost</b> of enhancing the video element to the selected level on the side. At the bottom of the control panel, you will see the total cost of your purchase across all the elements.<br><br>5. The questions on the next page will be like the five questions listed below. <b>You can use these questions, which are related to the video on this page, to help you make your decision of the purchase.</b> Do note that you will be able to watch the video as many times as you want to answer the questions, and the questions will appear on the same page as the video.<br><br>6. <b>Once you have decided on your purchase, click submit.</b> The set of configurations of the video elements you have purchased will be applied on the video on the next page.
