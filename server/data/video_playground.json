	"Description":"<p>As introduced earlier, all five video elements impact an individual's video-watching experience. Now, we would like you to test out the video streaming prototype again, but with the control panel below the video player.</p><br><p>The control panel gives you the ability to configure the five video elements to various quality levels. Selecting a higher level for a video element will improve the quality for that element. <b>Please move the sliders to different levels and experiment</b> with how different combinations of the five video elements impact how well you <b>understand</b> the video's content. We will be asking how you feel about these five video elements on the next page. <b>You can change the control levels while the video is playing, but expect a wait of up to 3 seconds for the prototype to reflect the new setting.</b> Feel free to replay the video as many times as you want. </p><br><p>Please answer a few questions below the video <b>based on your experience with different quality levels</b>.</p><br>",
