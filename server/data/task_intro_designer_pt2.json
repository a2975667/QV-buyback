As a designer, your job is to assemble a video player.</b> Each video element has two qualities, a higher quality and a lower quality. Your task is to choose between the two qualities for each element and decide which one would go into your design of the video player. Following the selection, you will <b>set a price that you think represents how much each component is worth</b>. The sum of the prices for the five components is the total price of the video player.</p><p>Our system used your demographic information and the consumption preference survey that you just filled out and matched you with a participant from the buyer's group. <b> This buyer has similar preferences as you </b>. The buyer has the incentive to select the best deal that fits their needs and budget, i.e., they will decide whether to buy the product you designed based on the quality-to-price ratio. <b>If the buyer accepts the product you created at the price you set, you will receive a commission</b>. The commission is 10% of the total price.</p> <p>Click submit to start the task.</p>"
