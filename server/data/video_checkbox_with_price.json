	"Description":"<p>Based on your responses to the streaming consumption preference survey and your demographics information, <b>we have matched you with one potential buyer who gave identical answers</b>. Now, we would like you to help us <b>price the product you designed for this customer, who is similar to you.</b></p> <p>Think about how much the matched customer values each element and the amount they are willing to pay for them. Then set a price for each video element between $0 - $4. Please also briefly explain the rationale behind how you price the video elements in the text box. </p> <p>Remember, our goal is to <b>offer your configurations and prices to the matched customer similar to you.</b> Naturally, the more a customer values an element, the more they are willing to pay for it, and vice versa. The customer are willing to pay more for an element if it is enhanced than when it is not, only if the customer thinks the enhancement is <b>necessary</b> for their need. </p> <h4>How you earn the bonus:</h4><p>After you submit your price for each of the individual elements, we will show your product and prices to the buyer we have matched for you. The buyer will decide whether they would be willing to purchase the product at the price you set. <b>If the buyer accepts your offer, you will win a rebate equals to 10% of the total price you set.</b> </p> <p>In other words, the higher you price these elements, the more you can potentially earn. However, if the buyer thinks any of the elements is overpriced, they will walk away, and you will not gain anything.</p>",
