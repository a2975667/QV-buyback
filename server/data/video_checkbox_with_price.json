	"Description":"<p>You are matched with one buyer (BuyerID: B556093), who has similar preferences as you. Now, you need to price your product for the buyer.</p> <p> Every element comes with a cost, regardless of which quality level you chose. You will set a price for each video component between $0 - $4. Think about how much the buyer might value each element. <b>Naturally, the more the buyer values an element, the more they are willing to pay for it, and vice versa. </b> </p> <h4>Potential bonus:</h4><p>After you submit your prices, we will show your design and prices to this buyer (BuyerID: B556093). The buyer will decide whether they purchase the product at your set price. <b>If the buyer accepts your offer, you will win a commission that equals 10% of your total set price.</b> (For example, if you set the total price at $20, and if the buyer accepts your design, you will receive a $2 bonus.)</p> <p>In other words, the higher you price these elements, the more you can potentially earn. However, if the buyer thinks <b>any of the elements is overpriced</b>, they will walk away and you will not gain any bonus. If the buyer thinks that the product does not help them complete their goal of <b>understanding the video</b>, they may walk away too.</p>",
