	"Description": "<p> As introduced earlier, there is only limited internet bandwidth when flying. Researchers of a video streaming company would like to hear customer's opinions about the importance of each of the five video elements. </p> <p>The reseacher would like you to complete three related tasks. This is the <u>first task</u>.</p> <p> You are presented with a weather forecast video below. Due to limited bandwidth, the current video has a lousy quality. <b>Please use the control panel below to experience how various settings of the video elements impact your understanding of the content. You can combine varying levels of the different video elements using the corresponding sliders.</b> </p> <p> Each slider has four levels. Level 0 on the left is the default level with the worst quality; Level 3 on the right is the best available quality; Level 1 and 2 are intermediate levels enhanced from Level 0. Overall, quality steadily improves as a slider moves through level 0 to level 3. </p> <p>Do note that this is <u>a sandbox</u> for you to experience the different video elements. Nothing would be stored. Feel free to move on to the second task by clicking <b>Submit</b> when you think you understand the different video elements.</p>",
