	"Description": "<p> As introduced earlier, there is only limited internet bandwidth when flying. <b>Researchers of a video streaming company would like to hear customer's opinions about the importance of each of the five video elements.</b> The survey will allow the company to prioritize the different video elements when bandwidth is limited. <br><br> You are presented with a weather forecast video below. A few questions are shown below on top of the video to test your understanding of the video content. Due to limited bandwidth, the current video has a lousy quality. <b>Please use the control panel below to experience how various settings of the video elements impact your understanding of the content. You can combine varying levels of the different video elements using the corresponding sliders.</b> <br><br> Each slider has four levels. Level 0 on the left is the default level with the worst quality; Level 3 on the right is the best available quality; Level 1 and 2 are intermediate levels enhanced from Level 0. Overall, quality steadily improves as a slider moves through level 0 to level 3.</p><hr><p><b>Instructions:</b> <br>Keep in mind that you have two goals in this task:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Adjust the different controls below the video and test out how they impact your video-watching experience.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Answer the list of questions below the video <br><br> <b>To start:</b> <br> Click twice on the large triangle and the video will start playing.
