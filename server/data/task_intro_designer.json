As mentioned previously, Speedy Stream aims to offer an online video streaming service for cars via satellite internet, which works even in locations without mobile network. The satellite internet is currently expensive and has limited bandwidth. The company's goal is to offer an affordable product while meeting the needs of our customers.</p><p>This is the last section of the survey. The system randomly distributed all participants into two groups: the designer group and the buyer group. <b>You are assigned to the designer group.</b> Let us explain how these two groups work together.</p><p>A video player is composed of functions that take care of the five video elements you experienced earlier. There is a cost for each element to work, and the buyer has to pay for it. Think of it as assembling a video player. As a designer, your job is to choose between two components with different qualities that go into the final product of this video player. Following the selection, the designer will set a price that he/she thinks resembles that component.  The sum of these component prices becomes the total price of video streaming service offers.</p><p>Our system uses your demographic information and the preference survey that you filled out earlier to locate a buyer from the buyer group, who is very similar to you. Buyers will decide, based on the price-quality tradeoff, whether they buy the product that you designed. If the buyer chooses the product you created, you will receive a commission. The commission is 10% of the total price.</p>"
