As a designer, your job is to choose between one of the two qualities for each of these components that go into the final product of this video player. Following the selection, you will set a price that you thinks resembles that component. The sum of the five component prices becomes the total price that video streaming service costs.</p><p>Our system uses your demographic information and the preference survey that you filled out earlier to locate a participant from the buyer's group. <b> This buyer is very similar to you </b>.
