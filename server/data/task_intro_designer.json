The satellite internet is currently expensive and has limited bandwidth. The company's goal is to <b>offer an affordable product</b> while meeting the needs of our customers. We want you, the survey participants, to complete a task to help inform the company's decisions.</p><p>This is the last section of the survey. The system randomly distributed all participants into two groups: the designer group and the buyer group. <b>You are assigned to the designer group.</b> Proceed to the next page to see how these two groups work together.</p> <p>A video player consists of the five video elements you experienced earlier. <b>There is a cost for each element (i.e., component) to work, and the buyer has to pay for each element. As a designer, your job is to assemble a video player.</b> Each video element has two qualities, a higher quality and a lower quality. Your task is to choose between the two qualities for each element and decide which one would go into your design of the video player. Following the selection, you will <b>set a price that you think represents how much each component is worth</b>. The sum of the prices for the five components is the total price of the video player.</p><p>Our system used your demographic information and the consumption preference survey that you just filled out and matched you with a participant from the buyer's group. <b> This buyer has similar preferences as you </b>. The buyer has the incentive to select the best deal that fits their needs and budget, i.e., they will decide whether to buy the product you designed based on the quality-to-price ratio. <b>If the buyer accepts the product you created at the price you set, you will receive a commission</b>. The commission is 10% of the total price.</p>"
