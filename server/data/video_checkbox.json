	"Description":"</p>Just to reiterate. As a designer, your goal is to design a video streaming product that the buyer from the buyer's group accepts to buy. Based on our market research, many customers stated their need to <u>understand</u> weather forecast videos.<p><p>To help your design process, we broke your task into two steps. In this first step, you will identify one of the two component quality that gets implemented into the video streaming service. You can see how the video viewing experience changes as you select the different combinations of video components. You will be pricing each of these componenets after you submitted your design.</p><p>Remember, the buyer wants to understand the content of the weather forecast video. To help you make your decision and test out if the buyer would be able to understand the video, our quality assurance team designed three questions buyers will be asked about after watching your design. These questions are the following:<br>(1) Where would the highest severe threat be?<br>(2) What will the temperature be in Caribou?<br>(3) what is the correct temperature for Pierre?<br></p><p>Click \"Submit\" after you have finished your design.</p>",
