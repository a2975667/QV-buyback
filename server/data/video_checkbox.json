	"Description":"<p> As mentioned previously, Speedy Stream aims to offer an online video streaming service for cars via satellite internet, which works even in locations without mobile network. The satellite internet is currently expensive and has limited bandwidth. The company's goal is to offer <b>an affordable product</b> while meeting the needs of our customers. Based on our market research, many customers stated their need to <b>understand weather forecast videos</b>.</p> <br> <p> Please help us design <b>a minimum-viable product</b> for a group of our customers. These customers are <b>similar to you</b>, based on  the streaming consumption preference survey and demographic information. As the first step, we ask you to configure the quality levels of the product so that it is <b>just enough</b> for them to understand the weather forecast videos.</p> <br> <p> On this page, you are given a video with the default settings. For each of the five video elements, <b>you decide whether  you would like to enhance the video element's quality</b>. You can see how the video quality changes as you check or uncheck the \"Enhance\" box. The quality assurance team has designed three multiple-choice questions below to help you make these decisions. Your goal is to make sure that the finished product enables customers like you to answer these questions after watching the weather forecast video: <br> Q1. Where in the states would there be several feet of snowfall in the next 36 to 48 hours? <br> Q2. What is the temperature in South Texas? <br> Q3.What is the west coast city NOT shown on the map?</p> <h4> Click \"Submit\" after you have finished your design. </h4> <br>",
