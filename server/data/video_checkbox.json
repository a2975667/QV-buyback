	"Title":"Task -- Help Us Design a Product",
	"Description":"</p>As a designer, your goal is to design a video streaming product that the participant you were matched with buys. Based on our market research, many customers stated their need to understand weather forecast videos.<p><p>To help you design, we broke your task into two steps. In this first step, you will identify which quality level of a component gets into the video streaming product. The pricing will happen on the next step</p><p>Again, our goal is to ensure that the buyers understand the content of the weather forecast video. You can see how the video quality changes as you select the different qualities of these components.</p><p>To help you make your decision and test out if the buyer would be able to understand the video, our quality assurance team designed three questions buyers were asked about. These questions are the following:<br>(1) Where in the states would there be several feet of snowfall in the next 36 to 48 hours?<br>(2) What is the temperature in South Texas?<br>(3) What is the west coast city NOT shown on the map?<br></p><p>Click \"Submit\" after you have finished your design.</p>",
