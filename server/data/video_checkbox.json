	"Title":"Task -- Help Us Design a Product",
	"Description":"</p>Just to reiterate, as a designer, your goal is to design an <b>affordable</b> video streaming product that fits the budget and needs of <b>the buyer we matched for you</b> from the buyer's group. Based on our market research, many customers stated their need to <u>understand</u> weather forecast videos in cars.<p><p>To help your design process, we have broken down your task into two steps. In this first step, you will choose between the two qualities for each element and decide which one would go into your design of the video streaming service. You can see how the video viewing experience changes as you select the different qualities of the video components. On the next page, you will be pricing each of these componenets after you have submitted your design.</p><p>Remember, the buyer wants to <u>understand the content</u> of the weather forecast video. To help you make your decision and test out if the buyer would be able to understand the video, our quality assurance team designed three questions the buyer will need to answer after watching the video via your design. These questions are the following:<br>(1) Where would the highest severe threat be?<br>(2) What will the temperature in Caribou be?<br>(3) What is the correct temperature for Pierre?<br></p><p>Click \"Submit\" after you have finished your design.</p>",
