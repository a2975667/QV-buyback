# Quadratic Voting App

This is an open-source Quadratic Voting (QV) system with full front-end and back-end implementation. It is designed to be quickly launched with Heroku and can easily be customized.

## Quadratic Voting
Quadratic Voting was first introduced by Steven P. Lalley and E. Glen Weyl as a collective decision-making mechanism. Details of this voting process can be found here.

## Prerequisites 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
This app is built on Python Flask + Angular.
```
Angular 8.3+
Python 3.6+
```
To start the app, you need a `.env` file located in the server folder with the following schema:
```
# Mongo
mongo_url=[your mongodb url]
```

## Build
Run the following command for the first time
```
npm install
python -m venv .venv
pip install -r ./server/requirements.txt
```
To start the server
```
ng build && flask run
```
visit: localhost:5000/welcome/gp? to test

## Features
- Supports naive QV
- Supports multiple questions
- Supports rendering different set of questions through URL

## Customizing application
- You can customize the questions by editing json file: `server/data/example.json`. The schema should be the following:
```
{
  "setting":{
    "style":"binary"
  },
  "question_list":[
    {
      "qid":1,
      "question":"This is an example question number 1",
      "description":"This is the description place holder for Question 1",
      "options":[
        {
          "o_id":1,
          "option":"Option1",
          "description":"Description for option1"
        }, ...
```
- To add multiple QV files, place multiple json files usner `server/data/`. For it to be routed, you need to change the array in the file `utils.py` under ther `server` folder.
